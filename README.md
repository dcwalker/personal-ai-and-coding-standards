## Purpose

These files define coding standards, documentation practices, and testing expectations for this project:

- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**: Guidelines for all contributors (human and AI) covering coding standards, testing, documentation, and commit practices.
- **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)**: AI-specific directives for coding agents, including behavioral constraints and memory management.

Together, they help ensure that responses, code, and documentation follow consistent expectations.
